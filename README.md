# Ergodox-BT

This repository contains the design files (CAD and EPS) for a customized ErgoDox keyboard case laser cut with acrylic. It is based on Litster's [full-hand ErgoDox Acrylic Case](https://github.com/bishboria/ErgoDox/tree/master/ErgoDox%20Acrylic%20Case).

##Additional Features

 - 76 key layout (38 keys per hand)
 - Single spaced keys (easier to find) on the left and right most columns
 - Thumb cluster moved closer to hand keys at a shallower angle
 - Left-hand LED holes
 - Slightly narrower and shorter footprint
 - Cutouts for power switch and USB breakout board
 - Electronics (I/O expander, MCU, bluetooth, and battery) cutouts moved to the base of the hand

## Materials Used

 - Five layers of 3mm acrylic per hand
 - An additional spacer (layer 4.5 CAD files) can be used to allow for more clearance of the electronics and key switches
